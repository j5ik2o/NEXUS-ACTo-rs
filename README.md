Nexus means "connection," "linkage," or "center," and we believe it aptly represents the essence of the Actor Model for the following reasons:

- *Connection and Interaction*: Nexus represents the central point where various elements connect, reflecting the communication and interaction concepts in the Actor Model.
- *Distribution and Integration*: It illustrates how the distributed elements (Actors) of a system are interconnected, forming a system that functions as a whole.
- *Flexibility and Resilience*: Nexus suggests a dynamically formed connection point, implying the system's flexibility and resilience.
- *Abstract Concept*: It represents the essential structure and behavior of the system rather than pointing to specific implementations or technologies.
- *Multifaceted Meaning*: Nexus comprehensively expresses the diverse aspects of the Actor Model, such as computation, communication, structure, and interaction.
 
Nexus integrates the core characteristics of the Actor Model—distribution, interaction, modularity, and resilience—into a single concept, representing the essence of the system's structure and behavior.
